# Python
There are solutions of some basic problems and some tricky problems. There are also `hackerrank`, `hackerearth`, `codechef` problems. You can use all of these codes.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Contribution
This repository is opened to contribute or pull request related some good problems. let's build it a large collection of programmatic and algorithmic codes on python. More to more contributions make it accessible to others and make you a better programmer. So let's do it.
