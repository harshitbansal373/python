10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

lst=list()
lst2=list()
for line in handle: 
    line=line.rstrip()
    if  line.startswith("From:"):
        continue
    if line.startswith("From"):
        words=line.split()
        sp=words[5]
        sp1=sp.split(':')
        lst.append(sp1[0])
        
    else:
        continue
for w in lst:
    di[w]=di.get(w,0)+1

for k,v in di.items():
    tple=(k,v)
    lst2.append(tple)
lst2=sorted(lst2)
for k,v in lst2:
    print(k,v)
